<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This project made as a class assignment.It's purpose basically clustering unlabeled data using Dbscan algorithm.

**Features:**

* You can cluster any given data in csv format
* You can visualize clustered data in 2-dimension however you like
* You can see which data point is in which cluster by clicking the point in the chart
* You can print results in a txt file

### What is Dbscan algorithm ?

Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm proposed by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Jörg Sander and Xiaowei Xu in 1996. It is a density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/izzettunc/dbscan.git
```
2. Open **DBScan.sln** with Visual Studio

3. Make changes, run it, use it whatever you like :smile:


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
